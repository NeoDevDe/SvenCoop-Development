kHED is a 3d low-poly model editor for indie game developers and modding enthusiasts.
I released it back in 2009 as a freeware tool and it was quite popular among Half-Life
modding community for being easy to learn and functional enough for the job.

kHED lets you create models of any complexity, but mainly designed for low-poly props
(under 10k triangles). There's variety of geometry primitives like Plane, Polygon, Box,
Sphere, Cylinder, Tube, Torus, as well as procedural tools like "lathe" and "loft".

Texture mapping tool supports planar, cylindrical, spherical projection and basic
unwrapping  functions. There's also a powerful UV editor with a handy model preview
and ability to export UV map to use as background for texture creation.

Game engines support:
 - Import/export Wavefront *.obj files
 - Import/export Collada *.dae files
 - Import/export Filmbox *.fbx files
 - Import Blender *.blend files
 - Directly import Half-Life (GoldSrc) *.mdl and *.smd files
 - Directly export to Half-Life *.mdl files (NOTE: you need to have studiomdl.exe from Half-Life SDK)
 - Export to Ostriv assets (buildings, agents, skeletons)

You can also use Milkshape3D import/export plugins
Wide range of supported texture file formats including PSD, DDS, VTX and many others
