bspfix

== About ==
Name: bspfix
Description: A program to convert to and from the Blue Shift .bsp format.
Requirements: A computer running some form of Windows.

== Background ==
When Gearbox Software ported Blue Shift to Windows (from the Dreamcast) they
slightly modified the .bsp format by swapping a few bytes in the header. The
resulting .bsp files are incompatible with Half-Life and vice versa.

== Changelog ==

v1.1 (19/09/09)
- Removed some unnecessary code.
- Miscellaneous changes.
- Added red and yellow text for errors.

v1.0 (14/03/09)
