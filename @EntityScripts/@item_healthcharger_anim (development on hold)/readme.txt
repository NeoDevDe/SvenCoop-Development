Development on hold, because correct spawn of item_healthcharger is only working in decay maps.

Tried to get it running with folloowing useless additions:
 - modified entity placement std. for item_healthcharger equal to test map
 - copied all from decay map .cfg files into test map .cfg (incl. global sound setting).
 - copied all from decay main map scripts into main test map script.
 - copied all map settings from class 'worldspawn' into test map class 'worldspawn'.
