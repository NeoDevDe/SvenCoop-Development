The development of this script is on HOLD, because entities of type
'item_healthcharger' are only working in DECAY maps ('dy_xxx.bsp')
but in test map 'test_chargers' is a render problem with healthcharger body.

Tried to get it running with folloowing useless additions:
 - modified entity placement std. for item_healthcharger equal to test map
 - copied all from decay map .cfg files into test map .cfg (incl. global sound setting).
 - copied all from decay main map scripts into main test map script.
 - copied all map settings from class 'worldspawn' into test map class 'worldspawn'.

Result: Bug gets not fixed ! => Developmeent on hold !
